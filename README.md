# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Airbnb-Dataset

Summary of this Project-

Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who wish to rent out their homes with people who need to stay in that area. It now serves over 100,000 cities and 220 countries globally. It's a way for hosts to earn money while protecting their property from potential damage. However, it is a perilous venture that guests should avoid.

We are evaluating Airbnb's 2019 New York City (NYC) data for this research. Not only is New York City the most famous city in the world, but it is also the top global destination for visitors lured to its museums, entertainment, restaurants, and commerce. According to the Office of the New York State Comptroller, 66.6 million people visited New York City in 2019.


Analysis of data from thousands of listings provided by Airbnb is a critical component for the company. Our primary goal is to identify the essential metrics that drive property listings on the site. We will use basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) tools to examine and display the dataset from Airbnb in NYC. We discovered the distribution of each Airbnb listing depending on its location, as well as its price range, room type, listing name, and other relevant criteria. We examined this dataset from several perspectives and discovered some intriguing findings. This can aid Airbnb's marketing, finance, and technical teams in making strategic data-driven decisions.
